Referee asked us where the difference between Grimm's
analysis and the new analysis originates.

There are some possibilites:
1). A difference in the size of the dataset (this is definitely part of the cause). [ ]
2). A difference in the prior. [ ]
3). A difference in the likelihood (chi-square vs. Student's t). [ ]
4). A difference in the MCMC method. [ ]
5). A difference in the integrator. [x] No - we compared, and
  get equivalent results.

So, in this directory I am going to rerun the optimization analysis with
the original amount of data and compare the best-fit parameters and
Hessian uncertainties with the new dataset.

I'm going to take the times from:
/Users/ericagol/Observing/Spitzer/Cycle13/TRAPPIST1/campaign02/December2017/
  timing_simon.txt
where contains the 284 times used in Simon's analysis (I believe).

(This directory contains a later analysis, but the transit times match
the original analysis which was used in the Grimm et al. (2018) paper:
/Users/ericagol/Observing/Spitzer/Cycle13/TRAPPIST1/campaign02/September2017/
  trappist1_timing_all.txt)

Some differences:
1). We don't have to integrate for as long.
2). Our starting orbital elements could be different.
