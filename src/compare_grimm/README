Referee asked us where the difference between Grimm's
analysis and the new analysis originates.

There are some possibilites:
1). A difference in the size of the dataset (this is definitely part of the cause). [ ]
2). A difference in the prior. [ ]
3). A difference in the likelihood (chi-square vs. Student's t). [ ]
4). A difference in the MCMC method. [ ]
5). A difference in the integrator. [x] No - we compared, and
  get equivalent results.

So, in this directory I am going to rerun the optimization analysis with
the original amount of data and compare the best-fit parameters and
Hessian uncertainties with the new dataset.

I'm going to take the times from:
/Users/ericagol/Observing/Spitzer/Cycle13/TRAPPIST1/campaign02/December2017/
  timing_simon.txt
where contains the 284 times used in Simon's analysis (I believe).

(This directory contains a later analysis, but the transit times match
the original analysis which was used in the Grimm et al. (2018) paper:
/Users/ericagol/Observing/Spitzer/Cycle13/TRAPPIST1/campaign02/September2017/
  trappist1_timing_all.txt)

Some differences:
1). We don't have to integrate for as long.
2). Our starting orbital elements could be different.

000:  This one used element from Sept2017, and got stuck and did not
optimize.  The covariance is not positive definite.

001:  This one used elements from December2017, and seemed to optimize
and used the Student's t distribution.  Here are the results:

002:  This one will use a chi-square distribution instead.  I'll continue
to use the Student's t-distribution, but set V_1 = 1.0 and set n_dof = 10^5
(this gives a distribution which is equivalent to a Gaussian out to ~4-sigma).

(I just lost the results - but this only took about 20 minutes to run).
